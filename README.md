# An Even Easier Introduction to CUDA (Updated)

This repository contains updated examples and tutorials for learning CUDA programming. It's designed to provide a gentle introduction to GPU programming concepts using NVIDIA's CUDA framework.

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit (latest version recommended)
- CMake 3.28 or higher
- C++ compiler with C++20 support

## Building the Project

1. Create a build directory:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Configure the project with CMake:
```bash
cmake ..
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
cmake --build .
```

The executables will be generated in the `build` directory.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the source code files
- `build/` - Build output directory (created during build process)
